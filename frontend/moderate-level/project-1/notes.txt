- Tagline	    : CSE Student | Aspiring Frontend Developer
- Lines 	    : I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build modern and responsive websites.
I enjoy creating clean, user-friendly designs that are both functional and visually appealing. My goal is to improve my frontend skills and eventually become a professional web developer. I’m always exploring new technologies and techniques to grow as a developer every day.
